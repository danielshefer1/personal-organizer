"""Who a message is from, as a tenant: the network-keyed identities of D12.

``tenant_identities`` is keyed by **network**, not by gateway. Meta's ``whatsapp`` channel and
the ``gowa`` gateway are both the network ``whatsapp``, so one person writing to either
number is one tenant (ADR 0004's "one person, one key"). A key is ``SenderRef.key``: ``uid:``
plus Meta's BSUID, or ``tel:`` plus the E.164 number.

A sender is looked up by every key their message carries, strongest first. The ``uid:`` key
survives a user hiding their number behind a username, and ``tel:`` is what the gateway and
the invite list know. Two consequences:

- Found by ``tel:`` while the message also carried a ``uid:`` (a Meta BSUID arriving for a
  number first seen on the gateway): the ``uid:`` key is added to that tenant, so their next
  message resolves even with no number in it.
- A new tenant is created on the ``tel:`` key when the sender has a phone (the strongest key
  otherwise), and every key not yet recorded is linked at once. Enrolling through Meta and
  writing later through the gateway is therefore still one person. A key owned by another
  tenant is skipped and logged as ``tenant.identity_conflict``.

Resolution and creation run as ``app_user`` through the two ``SECURITY DEFINER`` functions
(D1). The worker cannot read ``tenant_identities`` before it knows the tenant, by design.
