"""Application settings.

One ``Settings`` object, assembled from environment variables with ``__`` as the nesting
delimiter: ``DATABASE__APP_URL``, ``MODELS__CHAT_MODEL``, ``LOGGING__PII_PEPPER``.

The important design choice here is ``_enforce_deployed_invariants``: in staging and
production the settings *tighten*, and a service that is misconfigured in a way that could
leak PII refuses to boot. Railway's healthcheck then fails the deploy and rolls back, which
is far better than a service that comes up happily and writes phone numbers to stdout.

Which puts all of the weight on ``APP__ENV``, and it used to default to ``"local"`` in
silence. Omitting one variable therefore disabled every check at once rather than tripping
any of them -- so the gate is now guarded by :func:`_on_platform`, which asks the platform
instead of asking the operator.
