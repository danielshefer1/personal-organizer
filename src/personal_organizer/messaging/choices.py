"""A channel-neutral choice, rendered as numbered text (D9).

Linked-device WhatsApp cannot be relied on to show buttons. Later steps depend on choices,
starting with the Confirm step for calendar writes. So a choice is a messaging concept, not a
channel feature. It goes out as plain text through ``send_once``, and ``OutboundChannel`` does
not change. Native rendering (Meta buttons, GOWA polls) is a later ``send_choice`` on the
channels that can do it. :func:`resolve` already accepts what those send back: the picked
option's id arrives as the inbox row's ``reply_id``.

**The caller owns which choice is open.** That is ``tenants.onboarding_step`` now and
``pending_actions`` later. The caller rebuilds the same :class:`Choice` from that state on
every message. No choice is ever stored, so there is nothing to expire and nothing that can
disagree with the state. A reply that resolves to nothing returns ``None``, and the caller
decides between re-prompting and treating it as free text.

At most nine options, so every numbered reply is a single digit and "12" can never be read
as "1" plus noise.
