"""Messaging channel interface.

WhatsApp now; Iteration 13 requires contract tests so a Telegram adapter can be added in
one to two days after the beta. Nothing above this Protocol may assume WhatsApp.

Split in two halves because the two processes use disjoint halves: the api only verifies
and parses what arrives (and so never needs an HTTP client), the worker only sends. The
types between them are provider-neutral: a provider's message id is an opaque string, and
the sender is a :class:`SenderRef`, never a bare phone number, because a WhatsApp user who
has set a username can reach us with no phone number in the payload at all.
