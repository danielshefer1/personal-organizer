"""Sentry wiring.

Sentry does not go through structlog, so the log redaction chain gives it no protection at
all: it captures exceptions directly, and exception messages from asyncpg and Pydantic embed
the offending values. Both hooks below run the event through the *same* :func:`scrub_text`
the log redactor uses -- a separate implementation here is how the two silently drift apart.

They also share :func:`~personal_organizer.observability.redaction.is_opaque_id`, and for the
same reason. A Sentry event is mostly correlation identifiers -- ``event_id``, ``trace_id``,
``span_id``, ``release`` -- all of which are long hex strings that ``scrub_text``'s token rule
would otherwise replace with a marker, leaving an issue that cannot be tied to the log line
that produced it.
