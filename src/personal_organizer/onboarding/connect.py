"""The connect flow behind ``/connect``: open a link, hand the browser to Composio, finish on
the callback.

D4: a link is spent on POST, never on GET, because WhatsApp fetches links to build previews.
:func:`open_link` reads (the tenant's language and number, for the page) and writes nothing.

D5: the callback believes Composio's API, not its query string. :func:`complete_connect`
verifies our signed state, fetches the account and checks it before it binds anything.

A tenant who is already connected and opens an old link, or reloads the callback tab after the
state's hour, is told so (:class:`AlreadyConnected`) rather than sent back to the bot for a new
link: the bot only acknowledges an active tenant, so that would be a circle.
