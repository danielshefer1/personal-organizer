"""System tasks.

``ping`` is the walking skeleton's proof of life: the api defers it, the worker picks it up
and touches Postgres. That round trip exercises api -> queue -> worker -> database, which is
the point of Iteration 01.

Tasks are registered through a function rather than a module-level ``Blueprint`` because
``App.add_tasks_from`` mutates the blueprint in place, prefixing each task name with the
namespace. Registering the same blueprint with a second App therefore yields
``system:system:ping``. A registration function keeps no shared mutable state, so building
an app twice in one process (tests, a future management command) is safe.

Task arguments carry identifiers only, never user content -- see docs/adr/0001.
