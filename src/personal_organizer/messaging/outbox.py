"""Sending a reply at most once.

WhatsApp's Cloud API has no idempotency key, and a job can run more than once: Procrastinate
retries a transient failure, and a job interrupted by a deploy is retried from the top. So
each send is claimed in ``channel_outbox`` before it is sent. A reply to an inbound message
is keyed on ``(inbox_id, kind)``. A send that answers nothing ("You're all set", reminders
later) is keyed on an ``idempotency_key`` that names the event, e.g.
``connected:<connection_id>`` (D6). The key is unique across kinds and must never contain
message content. Either way the row moves through::

    pending -> sending -> accepted            (Meta took it; its statuses follow)
                       -> failed              (Meta refused; not retried)
                       -> unknown             (may or may not have arrived; not retried)
                       -> pending             (definitely not sent; the job retries)

A retry that finds the row still ``sending`` knows the previous attempt died mid-send and
cannot know whether the message arrived -- so it marks the row ``unknown`` and does *not*
send again. Missing one acknowledgement is better than sending two. See docs/adr/0003.
